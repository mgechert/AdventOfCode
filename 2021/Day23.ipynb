    "Amphipods can move up, down, left, or right so long as they are moving into an unoccupied open space. Each type of amphipod requires a different amount of energy to move one step: `Amber` amphipods require `1` energy per step, `Bronze` amphipods require `10` energy, `Copper` amphipods require `100`, and `Desert` ones require `1000`. The amphipods would like you to find a way to organize the amphipods that requires the least total energy.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "However, because they are timid and stubborn, the amphipods have some extra rules:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Amphipods will never stop on the space immediately outside any room. They can move into that space so long as they immediately continue moving. (Specifically, this refers to the four open spaces in the hallway that are directly above an amphipod starting position.)\r\n",
    "- Amphipods will never move from the hallway into a room unless that room is their destination room and that room contains no amphipods which do not also have that room as their own destination. If an amphipod's starting room is not its destination room, it can stay in that room until it leaves the room. (For example, an Amber amphipod will not move from the hallway into the right three rooms, and will only move into the leftmost room if that room is empty or if it only contains other Amber amphipods.)\r\n",
    "- Once an amphipod stops moving in the hallway, it will stay in that spot until it can move into a room. (That is, once any amphipod starts moving, any other amphipods currently in the hallway are locked in place and will not move again until they can move fully into a room.)\r\n",
